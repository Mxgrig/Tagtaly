In its first year of operation, Neko says that 1% of its patients received potentially life-saving intel, which is not nothing.

It is set in the futuristic World State, whose citizens are scientifically engineered to fit into a hierarchy. Eugenics, psychotropic pharmaceuticals and classical conditioning are employed to maximise stability and happiness. Huxley\u2019s novel does not describe a conventionally authoritarian system, but one in which the desire for freedom and dignity has simply been eliminated. The World State is a radical technocracy.<br /><br />\n It\u2019s a satire on the consequences of importing scientific thinking into the realm of social policy. The Controllers of the World State preside over a society that has rationality and efficiency as its guiding principles, and when those principles conflict with human nature, it is human nature that is required to give way. Rather than building a society that engenders happy human beings, the Controllers seek to design human beings that can function in the society into which they are \u201chatched\u201d.<br /><br />\n The idea that we would invert our relationship with the world in this way strikes us as sinister, as antithetical to what it means to be human. <br /><br />\n And yet something resembling this upside-down mindset is now emerging across the globe, particularly in the debate around climate change.</p><p>Having built a system that is destructive of the environment that surrounds and sustains us, we are now proposing to change \u2026 the environment! In his dystopia Huxley imagined a society that only worked when the humans within it were made into something not quite human. Today, many scientists and engineers imagine a planet that has been similarly transformed: nature itself must yield to the system. We need a technological <em>fix</em>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/19/techno-capitalists-think-innovation-can-save-the-planet-but-that-same-thinking-is-what-got-us-here\">Continue reading...</a>",

It\u2019s synonymous with fireworks, bright colours, endless parties and tables creaking under the sheer weight of food and desserts. No Diwali is complete without boxes of sweets (<em>mithai</em>) and dried fruit exchanged between friends and family. In the UK, we keep those traditions alive, dressing up, visiting temples, reading Indian mythology to the kids and, most importantly, gathering with friends from every background and religion. For me, Diwali is about togetherness and sharing food that feels special, but doesn\u2019t keep you in the kitchen for hours.

It\u2019s a shame then that her latest work, We Caliban, inspired by The Tempest, doesn\u2019t manage to convey her rich ideas around this key character. We begin with a letter from Elizabeth I to Walter Raleigh from 1584, giving him licence to set out and conquer foreign lands, then maps of Caribbean islands, their original names crossed out and replaced with Anguilla, Grenada, Barbuda. Jeyasingh\u2019s postcolonial take on the text seems clear, Prospero the invader forcing native Caliban into servitude. But having established this on stage, the idea dissipates into something much more impressionistic, the conceptual thrust is lost. We\u2019re led into a story and then left stranded, like a Milanese duke and his daughter on a remote island.</p><p>Jeyasingh\u2019s dancing is always well wrought. Her background is in the Indian classical form bharatanatyam, melded with western contemporary dance, and she has a classicist\u2019s feel for proportion and precision, an acute (no pun intended) sense of angle and line. Character is less of a concern \u2013 the dancers aren\u2019t \u201cacting\u201d, as such \u2013 and the effect is flat. Prospero, with his book and his staff, controls in fairly benign fashion. Caliban gets more interesting. Dancer Ra\u00fal Reinoso Acanda (formerly of Cuba\u2019s Acosta Danza) has two key duets: first with Miranda, where there is resistance, or resentment, perhaps, but also a connection between them that leads to tenderness. Then after the colonists have left, a second enigmatic duet (with an unnamed woman, one of the island\u2019s original inhabitants). This one is cool and careful, the two are fascinated, yet wary and distant \u2013 their fingers only just touching in a long stretched pose. They look at the audience rather than each other, but they seem to have a kind of mutual understanding. What\u2019s going on here? The fallout, perhaps of trying to rebuild yourself when you\u2019ve been stripped of what was essentially you? Caliban now trying to work out how to be himself, how to live, how to trust?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/oct/19/shobana-jeyasingh-dance-we-caliban-review-york-theatre-royal\">Continue reading...</a>",

It\u2019s adapted by Jackman from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/09/one-hundred-nights-hero-isabel-greenberg-review\">Isabel Greenberg\u2019s 2016 graphic novel of the same title</a>, and inspired generally by Scheherazade and the One Thousand and One Nights \u2013 and also I think by Julie Dash, Peter Greenaway and maybe the theatricality of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_and_One_Nights\">Agn\u00e8s Varda\u2019s One Hundred and One Nights</a>. Emma Corrin and Maika Monroe star, with Nicholas Galitzine and Amir El-Masry in support; Charli xcx makes an appearance, and there\u2019s also a tiny intriguing cameo for critic Sophie Monks Kaufman. It adds up to a likable movie, a little fey but unexpectedly subtle \u2013 although the meta-level of storytelling sometimes has for me the disconcerting effect of halting and dissipating the all-important narrative energy.</p><p>We are in a fairytale medieval world created by the god Birdman (Richard E Grant). Or rather, a world envisioned originally as a gender-coeval utopia by his daughter Kiddo (Safia Oakley-Green), but then spoiled by Birdman in a fit of sexist pique. In this place, women are not allowed to read or write but they are allowed to tell stories, and it is this skill that distinguishes the maidservant Hero (Corrin), who waits upon the shy, melancholy noblewoman Cherry (Monroe), and has become her intimate best friend.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/20/100-nights-of-hero-review-emma-corrin-london-film-festival-julia-jackman-maika-monroe-charli-xcx\">Continue reading...</a>",

Alice insisted that Crowe skip two school grades, driving his precocity; she was also dead against rock\u2019n\u2019roll on account of its unbridled hedonism. When Crowe asks her what Elvis did on The Ed Sullivan Show that was so subversive he had to be filmed from the waist up, she \u201cclinically\u201d replies: \u201cHe had an erection\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/20/the-uncool-by-cameron-crowe-review-inside-rocks-wildest-decade\">Continue reading...</a>",

Arne Slot, a manager lauded for smart substitutions last season, took a gamble in the 62nd minute, making three changes that aggressively shifted Liverpool into a 4-2-4, leaving Curtis Jones and Florian Wirtz dangerously exposed in midfield. The gamble initially appeared worthwhile: after rattling a post twice, Cody Gakpo finally delivered a 78th-minute equaliser to breathe some life into the deflated Anfield crowd. But Ruben Amorim remained calm and trusted his vision. Liverpool were undone just six minutes later after Bruno Fernandes\u2019s fantastic cross found Harry Maguire inexplicably alone at the far post, the lack of defensive bodies evident as he thumped in the winner. Slot was hoping for a high-risk, high-reward outcome but ultimately, United\u2019s grit in the second half paid off. Amorim has his critics \u2013 droves of them \u2013 but his tactics, including starting Maguire, were vindicated to earn United\u2019s first win at Anfield since 2016. Two league wins on the bounce is a first for Amorim at United. Are the wheels shifting? \u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassing stat to have had,\u201d said Maguire. \u201cWe have to start putting a bit more consistency together.
