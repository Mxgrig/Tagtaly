Their memories didn\u2019t seem as good \u2013 was that even possible, they asked her? Kosmyna herself had been struck by how quickly people had already begun to rely on generative AI. She noticed colleagues using ChatGPT at work, and the applications she received from researchers hoping to join her team started to look different. Their emails were longer and more formal and, sometimes, when she interviewed candidates on Zoom, she noticed they kept pausing before responding and looking off to the side \u2013 were they getting AI to help them, she wondered, shocked.

It\u2019s the most widely marked festival in India and feels a bit like Christmas does in the west. It\u2019s synonymous with fireworks, bright colours, endless parties and tables creaking under the sheer weight of food and desserts. No Diwali is complete without boxes of sweets (<em>mithai</em>) and dried fruit exchanged between friends and family. In the UK, we keep those traditions alive, dressing up, visiting temples, reading Indian mythology to the kids and, most importantly, gathering with friends from every background and religion. For me, Diwali is about togetherness and sharing food that feels special, but doesn\u2019t keep you in the kitchen for hours. The bread pudding is my take on the indulgent <em>shahi tukda</em>, while the ladoos are perfect to gift or to enjoy with a cup of chai after the feast.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/oct/20/diwali-recipes-easy-ladoos-indian-bread-pudding-karan-gokani\">Continue reading...</a>",

We didn\u2019t have any lemons. We did have kiwis. He proudly presented me with a dish of broccoli and kiwi. And, in his wisdom, he decided to boil the sliced kiwi with the broccoli, for rather longer than was necessary. His hope (he explained later) was that the broccoli would become \u201cinfused\u201d with the kiwi flavour. Strangely, the opposite happened. The meal was rather bland, overcooked broccoli accompanied by broccoli-flavoured semi-transparent kiwi mush. My partner maintains he is a \u201cvisionary\u201d aligned with Heston Blumenthal. I continue to disagree. <strong>Liz, Bath</strong></p><p>I had bought my first home as a young soldier.

It was the first meal I\u2019d cooked from a recipe and I thought two <em>cloves</em> of garlic meant two <em>bulbs</em>. Cue the amazing smells, mostly garlic, for some reason. I served it with much panache to the guys. Then watched their faces as they and their taste buds slowly died inside.

Freshly made gnocchi, with fluffy baked potatoes, however, are light as air, pillowy and silky. If that sounds intimidating, let me reassure you that this recipe is really forgiving, and much easier than making fresh sheet pasta.

Sometimes they are forcibly toppled, such as in the case of 17th-century slave trader, Edward Colston, whose bronze statue was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">rolled into Bristolian waters in 2020</a>.

He also tries to co-opt his Black room-mate, Isaiah (Ernest Kingsley Jr), for his cause.

It\u2019s a shame then that her latest work, We Caliban, inspired by The Tempest, doesn\u2019t manage to convey her rich ideas around this key character. We begin with a letter from Elizabeth I to Walter Raleigh from 1584, giving him licence to set out and conquer foreign lands, then maps of Caribbean islands, their original names crossed out and replaced with Anguilla, Grenada, Barbuda. Jeyasingh\u2019s postcolonial take on the text seems clear, Prospero the invader forcing native Caliban into servitude. But having established this on stage, the idea dissipates into something much more impressionistic, the conceptual thrust is lost. We\u2019re led into a story and then left stranded, like a Milanese duke and his daughter on a remote island.</p><p>Jeyasingh\u2019s dancing is always well wrought. Her background is in the Indian classical form bharatanatyam, melded with western contemporary dance, and she has a classicist\u2019s feel for proportion and precision, an acute (no pun intended) sense of angle and line. Character is less of a concern \u2013 the dancers aren\u2019t \u201cacting\u201d, as such \u2013 and the effect is flat. Prospero, with his book and his staff, controls in fairly benign fashion. Caliban gets more interesting. Dancer Ra\u00fal Reinoso Acanda (formerly of Cuba\u2019s Acosta Danza) has two key duets: first with Miranda, where there is resistance, or resentment, perhaps, but also a connection between them that leads to tenderness. Then after the colonists have left, a second enigmatic duet (with an unnamed woman, one of the island\u2019s original inhabitants). This one is cool and careful, the two are fascinated, yet wary and distant \u2013 their fingers only just touching in a long stretched pose. They look at the audience rather than each other, but they seem to have a kind of mutual understanding. What\u2019s going on here? The fallout, perhaps of trying to rebuild yourself when you\u2019ve been stripped of what was essentially you? Caliban now trying to work out how to be himself, how to live, how to trust?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/oct/19/shobana-jeyasingh-dance-we-caliban-review-york-theatre-royal\">Continue reading...</a>",

My all-girls school was known locally as \u201cthe pram pushers\u201d \u2013 the first person in my cohort to get pregnant was 13; in my sister\u2019s it was an 11-year-old \u2013 and my mother worked as a family planning doctor in the 16th-poorest borough of the country. The girls she met, the stories she heard, were \u2013 like those of the pregnant girls at school \u2013 stories of deprivation, vulnerability, gullibility and predation by adult men or older teenage boys.</p><p>All of which means that I grew up not giving much thought to the fathers of these children\u2019s children (except it being pretty clear in my mind that the adults needed to be in prison). The young mothers were the focus, they and their imminent children the lives in most urgent need of intervention. The men could and did walk away, for many obvious reasons. The boys could too, and largely did. It has been that way since time immemorial. The one who doesn\u2019t grow the baby can leave it much more easily. On this, physics and emotions are for once in perfect agreement.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/20/joe-swash-forgotten-young-dads-review-a-shoddy-hour-of-useless-television\">Continue reading...</a>",

      "summary": "<p>Head coach has plenty to address as his side find themselves in unfamiliar territory after four consecutive defeats</p><p>For almost the entirety of Mohamed Salah\u2019s Liverpool career, Anfield would have been in uproar over the forward being withdrawn moments after their team had fallen behind and with the clock ticking down on another defeat. Especially facing Manchester United, against whom he has scored a record 16 goals. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/19/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Not on Sunday</a>. Salah\u2019s 85th-minute substitution for Jeremie Frimpong was accepted as a necessary last throw of the dice following another poor display from the Egypt international. The reaction to the switch was telling. Salah\u2019s guaranteed place in Liverpool\u2019s starting lineup is under threat for the first time since he joined more than eight years ago. The threat would be greater if Federico Chiesa or Frimpong, the only real alternatives on the right, made as much of an impact when starting as they do off the bench. There are no replacements of Salah\u2019s level in the squad for the system that Slot operates. Any dip in form by the 33-year-old is therefore felt acutely. Whether it is helping Salah by selecting a more settled side around him, or rewarding Chiesa\u2019s lively cameos with a starting role, Slot has a pressing issue to address on the usually phenomenal side of Liverpool\u2019s forward line.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/20/the-salah-question-and-full-back-dilemma-what-must-slot-do-to-rejuvenate-liverpool\">Continue reading...</a>",

But it is also a book about how a young woman becomes a hero. And yet here she is, having to charm us out of shrinking from her in horror.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/20/nobodys-girl-by-virginia-roberts-giuffre-review-a-devastating-expose-of-power-corruption-and-abuse\">Continue reading...</a>",
