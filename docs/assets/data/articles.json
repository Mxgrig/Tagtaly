According to <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/physical-activity/latest-release\">the Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>, 46.9% of Australian adults described their jobs as mostly sitting down, which might explain why <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/physical-activity/latest-release\">only 22.4% of Australian adults met the physical activity guidelines in 2022.</a> In England, one in four <a href=\"https://www.sportengland.org/news-and-inspiration/record-numbers-playing-sport-and-taking-part-physical-activity\">do less than 30 minutes of exercise a week</a>, and in the US only about <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/exercise.htm\">half of the adult population</a> is meeting <a href=\"https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf\">the guidelines</a> of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise a week.

      "summary": "<p>A biscuit crossed with a flapjack crossed with a bread pudding: these snacks are best enjoyed with a hot drink</p><p>This, then, was the situation: it was Friday night after a long week, and having met a friend on the way home for a glass of wine, which arrived with crisps, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/oct/25/rachel-roddy-recipe-lemon-knot-biscuits-taralli-snacks\">taralli</a></em>, dry roasted peanuts and enough salt that we needed another glass, it seemed a good idea to go home and cook polenta \u2013 the long-stir sort as opposed to the instant variety, although I always have that in the cupboard, too. Another good idea, which came to me as I pulled a new packet from the back of the dresser and ignored the flutter of tiny wings, was to make more than enough polenta and pour the extra into a Pyrex dish while it was still hot, so it could set into a block to be cut into slices and grilled the next day.</p><p>I\u2019ve written about polenta before; how the word is ancient and generic \u2013 referring to any mushy dish made from cereal flour and water \u2013 and how, after its arrival in Europe in the 1600s, it became synonymous with ground maize. There exists a world of different grades and milling, but, broadly speaking, when you buy ground maize (cornmeal) for polenta, you will have two options: finely ground (which might also be white) for a soft, thin polenta, and coarsely ground, which will have glassy-looking grains and makes an excellent body scrub and a harder, tastier polenta. The latter also takes much longer to cook, anything from 40 minutes to several hours, depending on who (or which packet) you consult, although in my experience an hour is almost always enough, and anything beyond that is more a way of deepening the flavour. Stirring is also a matter of opinion, with some saying it must be constant, while others (hello, Anna Del Conte!) noting that after 10 minutes, if the heat is low enough, you can in fact leave the pan to attend to other things, coming back every now and then to give it a strong, hard stir.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/oct/23/leftover-polenta-biscuits-recipe-rachel-roddy\">Continue reading...</a>",

This is, by all accounts, Pullman\u2019s concluding foray into the intricately constructed, infinitely beguiling realm he first unveiled 30 years ago, with the publication of Northern Lights. It\u2019s a realm whose geography maps on to that of this world, but whose history tacks and jibes with ours; where the humans look and think and act like us, but are accompanied by daemons, souls in animal form; where the skies are filled with witches and gryphons, but beneath those skies, buses are caught and tea is drunk, and middle-aged academics carry Harrods shopping bags.

Two, the Budget. Consolidation is one part of the puzzle. The other is what the Chancellor does to trim 2026 CPI \u2013 something we think will be very important given our projections of ~2.6% y/y CPI next year. And third, pay settlements. The MPC has yet to see the Low Pay Commission\u2019s NLW announcement and subsequently what that does to pay settlements.

      "summary": "<p>The venerable screen and stage star reveals why she insisted on meeting a bloody end in Edgar Wright\u2019s zomcom, loved working with Ricky Gervais and which of her film roles has the biggest Rastafarian fanbase</p><p><strong>Many actors transform from one version of themselves into another, like Al Pacino around the time of Scarface. Others approach their older selves until they inhabit them, like </strong><strong>Jim Broadbent</strong><strong>. You have remained your same self: graceful, poised, elegant and eloquent. How do you do it? </strong><em>DrHugbine<br /></em>One has absolutely no understanding of how one comes across. Well, I certainly don\u2019t. I\u2019m delighted [you] think that about me. I\u2019ve never thought of myself as an older person. There are far more interesting things to think about \u2013 what\u2019s going on in the characters\u2019 minds, where they find themselves in the situation given by the playwright or the screenwriter. I think I\u2019ve kept a naivety. Michael Grandage, a director who I know very well, saw Mrs Warren\u2019s Profession on YouTube, which I did with Coral Browne a hundred years ago when I was 24, and said: \u201cPhysically, you\u2019ve changed. But you haven\u2019t changed.\u201d I don\u2019t know quite how to take that. Perhaps I\u2019ve stayed the same.</p><p><strong>I can\u2019t imagine being in any situation so terrible that the words, \u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2013 Penelope Wilton\u2019s here\u201d wouldn\u2019t make things better. But what makes you lose your temper? </strong><em>CHARISMATA and arch54lg<br /></em>This morning, I was driving to do some shopping. I cannot bear people who hoot behind you before the lights have changed. Motorbikes do it a lot. Especially those Deliveroo people. When they do hoot me, I go even slower. On a wider scale, listening to the news \u2013 I\u2019m in a furious temper before I even start the day. But you have to listen. You have to take note of what\u2019s happening in Gaza. It makes me angry when politicians start to <em>not</em> do what the populace wants them to do.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/23/penelope-wilton-they-wanted-me-to-tone-down-my-death-in-shaun-of-the-dead-it-was-too-frightening\">Continue reading...</a>",
