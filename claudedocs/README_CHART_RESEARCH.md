- Update color dictionary in viral_viz.py
- Change surge alert colors (orange/purple)
- Test one chart

### Phase 2: Font Sizes (15 minutes)
- Increase titles to 28pt
- Increase values to 22pt
- Increase subtitles to 16pt

### Phase 3: Enhancements (30 minutes)
- Add hot pink for extremes
- Add color hierarchy to rankings
- Add medal emojis to people charts
- Remove all bar borders

### Phase 4: Testing (15 minutes)
- Generate sample charts
- View on mobile screen
- Test colorblind mode
- Get feedback

**Total time:** 90 minutes for complete overhaul

## Common Questions

### Q: Why not just use red and green?
**A:** Red-green is the most common form of colorblindness (8% of males). Plus, green for "decrease" is confusing (green = good in most contexts).

### Q: Why not a dark background?
**A:** 7 out of 8 top sites use white. Dark backgrounds:
- Look dated (2015-2020 trend)
- Hard to share on social media
- Poor for screenshots
- Lower perceived credibility

### Q: Why orange instead of red?
**A:** Orange conveys urgency without alarm. Red triggers "danger" response. FiveThirtyEight (10M+ visitors) uses orange as primary color - proven to work.

### Q: Are these colors too "playful" for news?
**A:** No. Bloomberg, FT, and Economist all use vibrant colors. Professional ≠ boring. The data is serious, the presentation can be engaging.

### Q: Will this work on Instagram?
**A:** Yes. Axios specifically designs for social media using similar approach. High contrast + vibrant colors = scroll-stopping.
